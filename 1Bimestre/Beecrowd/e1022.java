/*
You were invited to do a little job for your Mathematic teacher. The job is to read a Mathematic expression in 
format of two rational numbers (numerator / denominator) and present the result of the operation. Each operand 
or operator is separated by a blank space. The input sequence (each line) must respect the following format: 
number, (‘/’ char), number, operation char (‘/’, ‘*’, ‘+’, ‘-‘), number, (‘/’ char), number. The answer must 
be presented followed by ‘=’ operator and the simplified answer. If the answer can’t be simplified, it must be 
repeated after a ‘=’ operator.

Considering N1 and D1 as numerator and denominator of the first fraction, follow the orientation about how to 
do each one of these 4 operations:

Sum: (N1*D2 + N2*D1) / (D1*D2)
Subtraction: (N1*D2 - N2*D1) / (D1*D2)
Multiplication: (N1*N2) / (D1*D2)
Division: (N1/D1) / (N2/D2), that means (N1*D2)/(N2*D1)
